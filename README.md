# 🤖 Simple AI Chatbot (Streamlit + OpenAI API)
A simple AI chatbot web application built using **Streamlit** and the **OpenAI Python SDK**.  
The chatbot sends user questions to an LLM and returns concise answers in a clean web interface.
This project demonstrates **LLM API integration, environment variable handling, and simple AI web deployment**.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project integrates a **Large Language Model (LLM) "gpt-5-nano"** using **OpenAI API** into a web application.

## Workflow
User Question → Streamlit UI → OpenAI API (API Request) → LLM Processing (gpt-5-nano) → Response → Display in Web App.
The application allows users to type questions and receive AI-generated responses in real time.

### Workflow Explanation
1. **User Input**  
   The user enters a question through the Streamlit chat interface.
2. **Frontend Handling**  
   Streamlit captures the input and sends it to the backend Python logic.
3. **API Request**  
   The application sends the prompt to the OpenAI API.
4. **LLM Processing**  
   The Large Language Model processes the request and generates a response.
5. **Response Rendering**  
   The generated response is displayed back to the user in the Streamlit interface.

### Tech stack
Python| Streamlit| OpenAI Python SDK| python-dotenv (Environment variable management)

## 📊 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, the following concepts are demonstrated:

- **LLM API Integration**  
  Connecting a Python application to a Large Language Model using the OpenAI API.

- **Prompt-Based Interaction with Language Models**  
  Sending user prompts to the model and receiving generated responses.

- **Streamlit Web Application Development**  
  Building a simple interactive web interface for an AI application.

- **Secure API Key Management**  
  Using environment variables (`.env`) to store and load sensitive credentials securely.

- **Basic AI Application Deployment Workflow** 
  Structuring a project with dependencies (`requirements.txt`) and preparing it for local or cloud deployment.
